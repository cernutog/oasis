# OASIS - TODO List

## Roundtrip Check Enhancements
- [ ] **Improve "Line Diff" Consistency**: Refactor the terminology or the implementation of the Line Diff in the Roundtrip Check UI to better reflect that it performs a semantic comparison (ignoring purely aesthetic line differences like quotes).
- [ ] **Introduce "Attribute Diff"**: Implement a new type of check that identifies and marks differences at the attribute level.
    - Track missing attributes.
    - Track added attributes.
    - Track attributes with changed values.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Standardize semantic comparison across all validation modules.
- [ ] Enhance report visualization for structural discrepancies.
