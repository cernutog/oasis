PROJECT RULES

1. The user prompting requests is the project master. In case of doubt, before exploring possibilities, ask directly for information. In many cases he can give you the information you need.
Don't take long sequences of actions without interacting with him. Sometimes he wishes to give hints, recommendations, help, but you are too selfishly busy in finding a solution. Stop frequenty and ask.

2. Don't code anything before asking to the user. Writing it in tne implementation plan (which by policy is automatically approved) is not enough. Ask directly for the authorization to proceed.

3. All information included in OAS files must be derived by the Excel templates. Any kind of heuristics is strictly forbidden. Hard coding data is strictly forbidden. Taking information (e.g. values, enumerations) from sources that are not the Excel templates is stricltly forbidden.

4. The application must produce deterministic results with must depend exclusively on what has been written in the Excel templates. And must be able to work with different schemas, parameters, responses, bodies, etc. No ad-hoc solution targeted to address an issue are acceptable.

5. After any progress, evaluate the results against functional and quality regressions. Perform a QA assessment and produce a report with mandatory (if any) and recommended actions.

6. Key files, to understand the quality achieved, are the OAS present in the "Expected results" folder.

7. Git, git, git. Remember to version every change. Use snapshots before changes and use always development branches. The master branch must always contain the last consolidated and accepted result. Ask always to the user if a branch can be merged to master.

8. All reverts must be requested and authorized. Temporary reverts for tests anche checks can be executed autonomously only after having stashed the current situation. Nothing must be lost for a bad git practice.

9. Artifacts (implementation_plan.md, task.md, etc.) must be kept up-to-date as the "single source of truth" for the project state and plan.

10. Excel files are the ONLY source of truth for OAS data. If data is missing or erroneous in Excel, DO NOT hardcode fixes. Instead, generate a specific report highlighting the missing/incorrect data so it can be corrected in the source.
